# CProgramClass

Basically it simply contains *homeworks* and *simple toys* built in *class*

And technically, it's my first serious repository on github with a local repository
built on my PC. I'm trying to learn more about git, programming language and more...

I know that's not easy as I've felt now, but everything can be **better**.
